# Venmo Payment Analyzer

A python script to analyze venmo transactions to calculate the median degree of all transactions within a 60 second window.

## Installation

The script is intended to run with either Python 2 or 3, however it has only been tested with 2.7 and 3.4 at the moment.  No extra libraries are required to be installed except if running tests on the code (see [testing](#testing)).  The script runs on either windows or *nix platforms.  However, on windows, the script cannot be started using the `run.sh` script.
